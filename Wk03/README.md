repo for CL 

This week I expanded my wireframes for the Air Quality Monitor and spent time tightening up a design system and its overall fidelity. 

I also explored applying a bit of interactivity to the experience so users can punch in on data that may be more relevant or helpful to them. One idea I explored is the possibility of a 2 dimensional bar graph that shows average daily concentrations of PM2/VO2 and peak concentration across a 7 day history. Another idea is to create a line graph that conveys the same data in a different way. I think that showing concentrations over time is more inherently legible in a line graph and Iâ€™ll likely go in this direction if I decide to use historical datapoints in my experience.
